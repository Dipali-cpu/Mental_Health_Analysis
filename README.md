This project is part of my Data Science learning journey, where I explored the factors that affect mental health among technology employees from the derived dataset of OSMI mental health survey 2014.
The goal was to analyze patterns, visualize relationships, and build a machine learning model to predict whether an employee might seek treatment for mental health challenges.
Project Overview:

Data Cleaning:
Handled missing values, removed inconsistencies, and standardized categorical data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Used bar plots, pie charts to understand the impact of gender, workplace support, companies support on mental health.

Feature Engineering:
Encoded categorical and text columns using OneHotEncoder and LabelEncoder with pipelines.

Modeling:
Built a predictive model using Scikit-learn pipelines to understand which factors influence mental health treatment decisions.
 Tools & Libraries:

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn (Pipelines, StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder)
